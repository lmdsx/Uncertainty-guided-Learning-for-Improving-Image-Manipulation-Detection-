# Uncertainty-guided-Learning-for-Improving-Image-Manipulation-Detection


This is a personal implementation of UGL-Net (Only try critical content implementations) , so there are lots of difference compared to the official version. To learn more details about UGL-Net, please check the paper.


notes: Formulas content have been slightly modified according to actual situations, for learning purposes only, the effectiveness remains to be verified.
